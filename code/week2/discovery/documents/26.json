  "reviewText": "This book is perfect if you are trying to get your hands around what data mining and machine learning is.  Most of the books I have read on this subject want to start with equations and get more complex from there, with little practicality.  This book makes extensive use of examples and introduces the mathematical basis for algorithms where needed.  The authors make the point that simpler algoritms often work best for solving machine learning problems.  Similarly, I would argue, simpler books work best for understanding highly complex fields.  I very highly recommend this book.",
