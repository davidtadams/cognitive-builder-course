  "reviewText": "Looking at many good reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase this book. It's a decent book, but IMO it has been edited poorly and the code has not been tested properly.The introduction chapter got me really excited, just like other Manning's \"in Action\" books do. But once I started executing the code in chapter 2 \"Classifying with k-nearest neighbors\" I realized that the code had bugs. Though I could figure out what's wrong and fix the bugs, I did not expect this from Manning, after having read some of their excellent books like (The Quick Python Book, Second Edition,Spring in ActionandHadoop in Action).Moreover the book has some introduction to python and numpy in appendix A. I believe the author could have pointed the reader elsewhere for learning python and those pages could have been used to explain more of numpy and matplotlib, which the author uses freely without any explanation in the text. (Yup, be ready to read some online numpy and matplotlib tutorials and documentation.)If you don't know python, then you can do what I did: readThe Quick Python Book, Second Editionand then attempt this book.The figures in the book are not in color so you need to execute the code to understand what the author is telling. It forces you to actually run the code, which is good, but you can't read this book without a computer in front of you.Finally, I am a big believer in following the conventions of a language. I would have been really happy had the author followed PEP8 ([...]), because along with learning machine learning, you could have learnt some good python coding practices.",
