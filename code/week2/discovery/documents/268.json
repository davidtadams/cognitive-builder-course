  "reviewText": "This is a wonderful book written by luminaries in the field.  While it is not for casual consumption, it is a relatively approachable review of the state of the art for people who do not have the hardcore math needed forThe Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics).  This book is the text for the free Winter 2014 MOOC run out of Stanford called StatLearning (sorry Amazon will not allow me to include the website).  Search for the class and you can watch Drs. Hastie and Tibshirani teach the material in this book.",
