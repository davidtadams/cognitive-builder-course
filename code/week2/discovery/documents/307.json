After the 9GB download for chapter 5, the supplied source doesn't work and contains requirements to 32bit libs... huge waste of time...2. After moving onto in chapter 6, and after 24 hours of downloading tweets for sentiment analysis... I checked the files and they only contained \"The Twitter REST API v1 is no longer active. Please migrate to API v1.1\".Yes, I could go debug and fix the code / errors in other peoples code... but that is not how I want to spend my time learning a new subject, I have enough of that in my day job as a software developer :)",
