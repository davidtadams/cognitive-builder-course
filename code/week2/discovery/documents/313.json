  "reviewText": "This book is fantastic.  I've been through the first four chapters, so I can't give a complete review yet, but if the rest of the book conains surprises, I will update.Chapter 3 is on k-nearest neighbor and chapter 4 is on naive Bayes.  Both provide a clear explanation of the technique, and its pros and cons, along with a simple, non-programming example.  Then there is an excellent walkthrough of applying the technique to real world data, and some hints at how to improve the results by adjusting the inputs.  After each chapter, I felt that I was ready to apply the technique, with the understanding that I did not yet understand everything about the topic.  The chapters also are careful to explain that 1) the particular R package used has more options than have been covered and 2) there are other R packages to be investigated and experimented with.I just couldn't be happier with these chapters, and I am fired up to keep reading and working along with the examples.  It has been years since I have been reading a tech book and thinking, &#34;OK, just a little bit more, I don't want to quit yet&#34; instead of, &#34;Have I spent enough time and effort on this for one day yet?&#34;  It's that good.Although the book does provide a bit of an introduction to R, it is by no means comprehensive, and I have found that R takes time, patience and frustration to master (not that I've mastered it yet).  So if I had been a complete R newbie, I probably would have struggled more.I also found that a recent course I took in statistical inference was helpful, although not really required.  At one point the book describes normalizing features using Z scores.  I knew what Z scores were, so that was a point I didn't need to simply take on faith.If you are relatively new to R and machine learning, and you want to learn to do machine learning with R, this *is* the book.",
