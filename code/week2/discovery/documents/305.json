  "reviewText": "This is the book that I wish was available when I was first learning Data Science.  The author presents a thorough and well-organized approach to the mechanics and mastery of data science, which is a conglomeration of statistics, data analysis, and computer science.  Detailed explanations from multiple angles tie together the entire process of data science from novice to master.  The R statistical programming language is used extensively with clear examples of code and data visualizations.  The author leaves no stone unturned while covering topics broad and narrow.  I've done a lot of work with both R and data science, but still found quite a bit of good stuff in here.  This book should be on the shelf of every data scientist and R user.",
