It was a long read, especially with the holidays, but well worth it, and more enjoyable than almost every technical book I have every read.Strengths &#8211; Organization, having technical details in a side by side section for those who want it, covering details from definition, through use and application, as well as doing a good job explaining similarities and differences on key topics.Weaknesses &#8211; there are a few small places I wanted more.  Meaning if they could have somehow had more examples for the different models, situations, etc., especially as I got into more of the predictive models.",
