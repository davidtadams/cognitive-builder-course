  "reviewText": "I like O'Reilly books, it is a trusted source of technical information for me. Generally speaking, when encounter a new topic I look for the 'Learning' and 'Programming' series from O'Reilly. I think this book actually RAISES the bar for O'Reilly publishing in an already elevated plane. Here are my reasoning:1. Virtual Machine experience: Bar none, the best thing about this book is the companion Virtual Machine experience. Like many other reviewers mentioned, having a safe playground with demonstrable solution is invaluable. With the breadth and depth of the topics the books tries to cover, without the VM I think the weight of the information might just be overwhelming. I challenge O'Reilly to have a more interactive experience such as this one. &#34;Think Python&#34; has an interactive website, but that is not maintained by the author nor was the JavaScript experience as good as IPython Notebook.2. Engaged author: You can tell the author cares about his work, very, very much and take user feedbacks seriously. Don't take my word for it, check out the book's Facebook page or Twitter feed and judge for yourselves.3. Great Content: Funny this is number 3 on my list. But I really do think the other two comes before it. The contents are educational and informative. I learned a lot and feel like I am on good ground to go further in each of the topic if choose to.That is it. Nothing fancy, just three reasons I think why you should give this book a shot.
