  "reviewText": "The authors of this book are certainly no nobodies in this area. However, this does not imply that they are able to write good books about statistical learning theory covering a broad range of methods.In my opinion, the major problem of this book is, that it does not fascinate the reader. The opposite is almost true. One reviewer wrote, it is no book for beginners. Well, that is not my point. My point is, e.g., a chapter or section starts and the introduction provided to this topic under consideration is almost completely missing. Moreover, the explanations given in the main text are just not good. Sorry, it makes not much sense to collect and present a lot of deep results of scientific articles in statistical learning theory without the necessary explanations. One should not forget, each section corresponds roughly to one or even more articles. One would expect from the authors to provide a precise summary of the main points in an appealing way. Negative report! This is really sad, because, the colored illustrations provided in the book are just great.Certainly, no bad book, because it provides definetely a quite good overview, but sadly not good to read and the explanations are not insightful.",
