  "reviewText": "This book was used in my graduate level Machine Learning class (with certain readings/problems from the authors other more challenging book, The Elements of Statistical Learning).I loved the class and loved the book. I thought the applications with R made it far more accessible and made it easier to learn. While I totally love the theoretical underpinnings, sometimes they aren't the best to learn right away and applying the ideas make it easier to grasp.Rob Tibs & Trevor Hastie also had an online course offered through Stanford's EdX that ran the same time I was taking the course. It had videos of Trevor and Rob explaining the concepts in the order they were presented in the book. The course also included exercises and quizzes. The best part of the online course was that Rob & Trevor were absolutely hilarious. I loved their commentary and their personalities clashed in the most humorous way possible; it is very easy to see that they love what they do and love each other's company.I'd totally recommend this book. Keep an eye out for the next offering on Stanford's online course web page; it makes it a lot more enjoyable.",
