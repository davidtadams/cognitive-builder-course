  "reviewText": "I have used this book during my masters and found it to be an extremely helpful and a gentle introduction to the thick and things of machine learning applications. The various chapters are nicely paced with helpful problems at the end. Another great thing about the book is treatment of detailed examples with each concept and that the author carefully ties various concepts as they arise, with not just new, but also examples from previous chapters, which helps the user to understand different concepts applied to same problems thereby making clear difference between different methods. Also the author has a dedicated website with updated errata and notes, which is also very helpful! Having said that, I think the book is an introduction to various machine learning methods and one can easily follow on the references listed for detailed treatment of relevant topics.",
