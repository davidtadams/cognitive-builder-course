  "reviewText": "Because I do biostatistics at a university, I regularly attend informatics meetings and have spent years wondering if the machine learning people were relabeling statistical algorithms and if we were just relearning the same mathematical voodoo.  This book explains things in adequate detail to allow a statistician to map the machine learning vocabulary onto modern statistical terms.  It does an excellent job explaining the \"what, why and how\" of complex statistical/machine learning concepts.  The author does and *exceptionally* good job using graphics to build intuitions about what algorithms are used for and how they work.  The reader without a very strong background in mathematics (pure logic and/or set theory)  will find excellent introductions scattered throughout the book.  Needing to know that information makes this book a hard read but the summaries are surprisingly readable.I highly recommend this book for statisticians and others who want to know what informaticians and machine learning experts are up to.",
