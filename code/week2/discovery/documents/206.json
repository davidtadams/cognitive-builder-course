  "reviewText": "This is a really nice collection of case studies involving data mining with R. Both supervised and unsupervised methods are presented. The book is quite technical with big chunks of R code. However it is not a book about data mining or R. You will need other books  such asIntroduction to Data MiningData Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)The R Bookto cover these topics.",
