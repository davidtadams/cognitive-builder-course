  "reviewText": "Data Mining is a comprehensive overview of the field, and I think it is best for a graduate class in data mining, or perhaps as a reference book. The book's focus is on technique (i.e., how to analyze data, including preparation), and it addresses all the major topics in the field including data storage and pre-processing. However, the book is really about classification methods, and the 2 chapters on cluster analysis are particularly strong and thorough.For those looking for specific examples, applications, and domain knowledge, I would recommendData Mining Techniques: For Marketing, Sales, and Customer Relationship Managementby Linoff & Berry. However, for analytic techniques, this reference book is far superior.",
