  "reviewText": "It's hard to figure out who would actually benefit from this book - it amounts to seven hundred pages of equations interrupted by blocks of text that fail to provide any intuition whatever for the techniques they are describing, and the occasional graph which is remarkable in the universe of graphs as being scarcely more informative than the equations it is meant to illustrate.Seriously, you have to wonder wtf Bishop thought he was doing here.  As a catalog of equations for people who already thoroughly understand the learning algorithms I suppose the book can be considered adequate.  For any didactic purpose you're wasting your time - you can find dense, technically correct but incomprehensible descriptions for any of these methods online, for free.  A textbook ought to aspire to more - should bring some order to the chaos, re-tell a technical story in a new light to make it more sensible and intuitive.  This book is so bad in these regards that it makes me angry.On a related note, I can't believe that Duda and Hart is still the best machine learning / pattern rec. book on the market after thirty years or whatever.  This field is dying for a book by someone with even an INKLING of how to teach, or at least willing to make an effort to try.",
