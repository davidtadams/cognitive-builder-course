What Business Intelligence in Plain Language was able to get me to understand was that at a fundamental level, all business intelligence can be translated across industries and have relevancy.This allowed me conceptualize the industry I had been working in for over 5 years to a fundamental level. Then, I was able to take that new understanding of how business intelligence works and apply it to my new job. I was able to reuse and tweak strategies I had been using to make them better and more effective. I've learned all kinds of new things about business intelligence because of Business Intelligence.
