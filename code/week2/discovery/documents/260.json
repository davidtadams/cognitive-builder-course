I was very happy with how Matthew Russell was able to tackle the LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter APIs...then stay up to date too! You learn how to map out your social networks, using technologies like D3, and other graphic tools too.This is a hands down &#34;GET IT&#34; purchase, and you will get so far along with this book by your side.",
