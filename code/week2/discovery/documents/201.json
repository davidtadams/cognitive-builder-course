  "reviewText": "This book has sat in my Amazon Wish List for several years. I always put off buying it - until I actually needed a machine learning book.Pros: Unlike too many technical books, the author of this book is not trying to display his brilliance. This is a nuts and bolts book - not a cookbook, but not a Springer-style book of axioms, either. Reading this book reminded me of school. There seem to be two kinds of professors - one kind tends to prefer examples and problems that display some sort of first principle or other basic and fundamental problem. These professors are good at teaching new concepts, but sometimes fail at teaching the practicalities. The other kind of professor favors practical problems and how-do-I-do-this-for-real issues. This book sits firmly in the latter camp.Cons: As mentioned above, this book is not a cookbook, and yet is also is not rigorous. For such a practical book, I would have wanted more pseudocode and algorithms. For example, near the end of the book, the author goes over Kalman filters and particle filters. He gives one algorithm for a Kalman filter (whith no treatment to the different kinda and uses of Kalman fitlers), and only a slight description of a particle fitler (and no pseudocode). To be fair, books and volumes are to be had on the subject. But, I was left wanting more.This book is a good introduction to how to use various aspects and techniques of machine learning. If you a looking for mathematical rigour, look elsewhere. If you are looking for cookbook-style algorithms, use this book in supplement. If you want a practical overview of machine learning methods before setting on your course, buy this book.Recommended, but with qualification.",
