  "reviewText": "The book provides a very broad introduction into the topic. This is very good for someone who has no or not much background. On the other hand, the explanations are not very insightful nor very good to really understand the principles of the treated methods.Also, about 1/3 of the book is a kind of manual for the software provided by the authors.I would recommend this book to first or second semester students who want to get an overview of data mining, however, without expecting to gain a solid understanding.",
