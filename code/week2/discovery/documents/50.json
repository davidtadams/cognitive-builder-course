  "reviewText": "Good:Provides a good overview of the field as well as basic concepts in everyday language. It tries to explain any jargon that it introduces. I'm going to disagree with a reviewer. The book is not WEKA focused and is useful for people even if they are not going to use WEKA. Even if the book had a strong focus on WEKA, I don't see what's wrong given that WEKA is free and open source and widely used for machine learning and data mining. I'll elaborate more on this subject in the Bad section.Provides both overviews as well as more detailed discussions (such as potential applications) related to various types of commonly used algorithms. I felt the diagrams it presents were key to understanding the concepts.Applies the concepts using a library called WEKA.Bad:I didn't think the book focused enough on application. It's great to learn theory, but personally I don't learn a subject very well if I don't have enough opportunities to apply it. I totally disagree with another reviewer. I felt that the book should have had MORE content related to WEKA. Yes, WEKA is free and open source but there is so little documentation written on it compared to other Java libraries and frameworks. More content on it would have been better since there isn't a definitive book on it that didn't solely focus on the GUI application portion of WEKA. Besides there are plenty of other good books that focus on data mining and machine learning. This is the only one for WEKA.",
