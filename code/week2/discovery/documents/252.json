  "reviewText": "\"Data Science\", \"Data Mining\" and \"Predictive Analytics\" are some of the terms of recent vintage that define the application of modern mathematics, enabled by twenty-first century computing power, to identify patterns in the staggering quantities of data that can be so easily acquired and accessed.  This new technology has such important ramifications in areas ranging from market behaviour to cyber security that even laymen need to have an understanding of its far reaching implications.  One recent effort to make these ideas intelligible to the non-expert, the rather puerile \"Predictive Analytics\" by Eric Siegel, failed miserably.  This book comes much closer to the mark.With a readable, almost conversational, style Provost and Fawcett describe some of the fundamental notions in data science, casually discussing such standard topics as supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, regression, linear discriminants, model building and even a pseudo introduction to Support Vector Machines.  There is also a chapter on the danger of over fitting, a common malady afflicting those new to machine learning.  Of course, the authors' stated desire to avoid any genuine maths renders some of the descriptions opaque and even misleading.  Nevertheless, the alert layman will come away with a decent familiarity with some of the concepts and methods employed in this rapidly evolving technology.",
