  "reviewText": "I have learned basics of graphical models from a professor who is quite prominent in the field.He taught it from unpublished book by Michael Jordan + few chapters by Chris Bishop.I have not read most of the books but have read enough to write positive things about it. I especially like the part of the book that shows dependencies (bad pun alert). dependencies of chapters that is. :Dthe only complaint i have is not towards the authors but towards the publishers. the quality of paper is the worst i've ever seen and i own more than 400 textbooks. there are dusts all over the pages. you can feel your hands getting dry due to these paper particles and after a while you can't breathe because of these particles. some books have this but this book is the worst when it comes to that paper dust. you will know when you have this yourself.they could have slapped on $200 and worse paper quality, I would still buy it without thinking twice about it.",
