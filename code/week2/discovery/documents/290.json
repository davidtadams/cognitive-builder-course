  "reviewText": "If your looking for a very very basic introduction. Almost more talking point introduction then this book is good, yet very, very short..It was to simple, to basic, even the examples were third grade math word problems.. To much hype on how data does what a person can't.. Oh sure, great you can check your inventory while sitting on the beach miles away. Then again,, why? what if the manager of that cafe, know there was going to be a service interruption? or maybe the recipe was not being made right.I like the book for what it really is, a very quick and simple, very simple, summary.. I thought it would have more substance.. well, it is in very plain language, and is a very basic summary. I t did reaffirm, for me that I do know what this is, its just been given a new name.. again, this is just my own experience with this book.I'm 58 years old, so many there is a generation issue here, we learned mathematics, formulas, how to work with data, with computers, or without.",
