  "reviewText": "I think this is a great text considering the vast array of topics covered by Bishop in this book. The best thing I liked about the book are the fantastic insights the author has provided on various methods and their usage limitations, sometimes in very easy to understand language and studded with some real practical experience going behind it. One thing which I found rather missing was the excessive use of equations without much dwell into their derivations, which can sometimes confuse the first time reader, but when worked diligently by hand, would make the stuff clearer. Said that, the book is a great text for someone to gain latest perspectives on the field from the author's rich research experience. I would definitely recommend someone who wants a fairly broad and usable knowledge about this field.",
