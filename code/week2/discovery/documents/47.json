  "reviewText": "This is an excellent text. The authors early on define data mining \"as the extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data\". The techniques, methodologies and algorithms for achieving this goal are the crux of this 600 page text.It is grindingly thorough and only the dedicated will make it through the book without assistance. For those who do, they will have an excellent grounding in the theory and basic techniques of machine learning. The last third of the book introduces WEKA. WEKA is an open-source workbench that permits the data mining student to try out all the algorithms presented in the book. It's free and extensible.The reader needs a pretty good grasp of database technology and more than a little knowledge of statistics and math. The latter is not an absolute necessity, but will make comprehending this material a faster and easier process.The authors, collectively, has a clear writing style, free of academic cant. If you take it slow, everything ultimately becomes clear.Overall, this is an excellent introduction to data mining, but is not for those who expect to learn even the fundamentals of this technology in a few days time. That just ain't gonna happen.Jerry",
