Is it for Beginners trying to learn .NET?  NO!  Is it for intermediate programmers that work as developers simply b/c it's a way to earn a living.  NO!  Is this  a book for adrenaline junkie programmers who like doing stuff few if any others have done.  YEP.  I have well over 100 books on .NET and other than the proposed one I'm working on, not 1 covers Speech Server.  Sara jams on it.  Data Mining is another great area - sure, Data Mining is not inherently the sexiest subject out there, but she makes it cool.There are definitely zillions of other books out there to teach you .NET in general and this IS NOT that type of book.  But if you're looking to expand your horizons, and have a lot of fun learning some really cool aspects of advanced .NET Technologies, this book is without competition!",
