  "reviewText": "When I read Mena's book on data mining, it was one of the few references available on the subject. It was an excellent introduction to the subject for me, when I needed to understand the basic concepts and applications of data mining. The language is clear and concise. I drew heavily on it to provide the technical undergirding for my master's (public affairs) thesis on DARPA's Total Information Awareness project. (My rating is largely based on the book's usefulness when I read and used it as a reference in 2004. I cannot judge the book's current utility in the wake of more recent developments in data mining.)",
