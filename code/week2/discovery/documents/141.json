  "reviewText": "I am not a textbook reader; I often skim the chapters as I work through assignments. The textbook was great; information was pretty easy to locate. However, I believe it would have been helpful to add supplemental material that contains completed examples using XLMiner for each model. The documentation on XLMiner seemed to skim over often critical steps. I would question my confidence level of my results. Having the examples would give me something I could compare to.",
