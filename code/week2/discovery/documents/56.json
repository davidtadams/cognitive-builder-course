  "reviewText": "The authors write at a good level of sophistication. Aimed at a reader already expected to have a strong maths background and computing experience. In university terms, you probably need to be a junior level undergraduate or higher. The attraction of the text is that it explains well the gist of many computationally important methods in machine learning. The algorithms are covered in enough detail that you should for example be able to understand and intelligently use any software package that implements them. Or even to write code from scratch to instantiate an algorithm.To give you an idea of the book's comprehensiveness, these are some of the explicated ideas - support vector machines, linear models, Bayesian models, multilayer perceptrons, clustering and ensemble learning. There are complete books devoted to each topic [and other topics in this text], that furnish far more details. But maybe ironically, those often can bury the reader in a mass of lower level details. This book will let you quickly understand at a high level the basic intent and logic behind those algorithms.The choice of explaining Weka takes up the last third of the book. While some readers might decry this, Weka seems like a reasonable choice of a software package to illuminate in some detail. In part, this lets you see an implementation of some of the ideas in the earlier portions of the book. Which can be an attraction if you prefer or need an implementation to improve your understanding.Comment",
