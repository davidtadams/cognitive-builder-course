  "reviewText": "While this book is expensive, if you know some R already and you are looking for more examples for covering statistical learning/modeling methods, with sample code, this is an excellent buy. If you don't know R you will need to spend a bunch of time getting up to speed before you hit this book.Even though it is targeted at the business world the examples and code are widely applicable. From the table of contents and index you can get a feel for the topics covered. If you want to see the actual code used check the books website.  It is solid and includes the code, the data sets and an errata.  If you are curious to know what R libraries are touched, they  include: arules, car, class, cluster, elipse, igraph, lars, lattice, leaps, locfit, MASS, mixOmics, mixtools, nutsheell, ROCR, startnet, textir, tree and VGAM.This is a pretty book with great well annotated graphics to help you learn.  The writing is pleasantly clear and direct without being too terse. While the code could be better commented (for the R novices) in general it is good and the text which surrounds the code is very good.There are formulas here. The math complements the writing rather than being a deep dive.The references to outside work are on target but the author does not include some obvious choices likeAn Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)for a deeper look at the math orData Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-Based Approach (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics)for additional examples.Overall, this is an excellent book for someone who knows basic statistics and the fundamentals of R and who wants to learn modern methods using examples.",
