  "reviewText": "The book is not written for a beginner or even an intermediate researcher.  This is a very serious book on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.  If you are looking for computer code you can lift and use in your home grown system, this is not in the book for you.  If you have not had some serious math courses beyond the basics.  You will quickly be lost.  I have had 15 graduate math and statistics classes and work in IT currently.  I purchased this book to help me with a research project I am doing on my own with pattern recognition where machine learning is important to the process.  Many of my own equations as I did my research appeared in this book.  I am using a relational database to store information and remember patterns.  If you don't have experience with numerical methods and turning equations in to computer code and can do it in your head.  You will have great deal of difficulty with this book.  That said as a warning, now to the book.  It is a great reference and spends a great deal of time several statistical theories and their practical uses in signal and pattern recognition.  It also has various ways for doing curve fitting and dealing with weighted neural networks.  While this is written as a text book, it is more of reference book.  I do not see how even a years course could work on all the information in this book.  One of my chief pet peeves is that text book publishers have websites and answers only professors can get to.  How about those of us who are finished with school and have no intention of ever going back?  So to the publisher Springer I give one star and zero if I could!  This is a reference book and most likely will never be a text book. This is true with this book.  Which is why I rate it four instead of five stars because of the publisher.",
