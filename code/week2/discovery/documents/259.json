Suppose you were in the process of creating a product, but at the same time you are curious as to which niche it would fit into. You may also be curious as to which niche is the most financially beneficial for your product, as well as perhaps you should tweak it to maximize your particular niche after mining the web for this data.Who would benefit from this product the most? And best of all, which social websites do your prospective buyers frequent the most. Is it Facebook? What about Twitter? Do they have a membership on LinkedIn? Are they a member of Google+? Regardless of where they may be, there is a good chance that your data mining will pay off.There is plenty of example code, which makes use of the Python language. There is also IPython Notebook which is an interactive Python interpreter which gives you a notebook like experience from your web browser. With a few clicks from within IPython Notebook, you can be well on your way to learning more about the users of social websites than you might have ever thought possible.A part of the paragraph on IPython is paraphrased from the books itself. I would definitely recommend this book to others. It looks great on my Kindle Fire HD.",
