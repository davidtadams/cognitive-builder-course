  "reviewText": "The book is worth a look, but after some of 5 star reviews i read here, it was quite a disappointment. Yes, the book covers a lot of ground. Yes, the book has lots of nice pictures and easy examples, but that is exactly the problem. There are lots and lots of simple examples to explain the most basic concepts, but when it gets complicated the book often sounds as if the text was taken out of a mathematics book. For example: the basics of probability theory are introduced for over 5 pages with the example of \"two coloured boxes each containing fruit\". Nothing wrong with that. Then the chapter continues with probability densities which are covered within 2 pages and contain sentences like \"Under a nonlinear change of variable, a probability density transforms differently from a simple function, due to the Jacobian factor\". There is no mentioning how a simple function exactly transforms, what a Jacobian factor actually is and why we would be interested in a nonlinear change. Surely, some of the introductory pages could have been thrown out to explain in depth the more difficult issues. Unfortunately, this is not the only time, where easy concepts get a lot of attention and the truly important complex concepts are skimmed over. All in all, still worth a read, though do not expect too much.",
