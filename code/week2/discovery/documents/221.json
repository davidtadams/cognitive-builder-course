  "reviewText": "I started my journey in the machine learning / data mining field thanks to curiosity generated by Toby Segaran's classicProgramming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications. The book by Drew Conway and John White continues in the same excellent tradition. It presents case studies which are interesting enough that you can appreciate them without too much domain knowledge and without getting too deep into technical nitty-gritty. At the same time, the case studies are meaty enough that you can adapt them to real life problems and hack together a quick working prototype in your practice.By many estimates (and my own experience), 80% of time in machine learning is spent in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. This book has very good coverage of both areas. Authors use Hadley Wickham's excellent packages viz. ggplot2, plyr and reshape2. If you are doing serious exploratory data analysis in R, these packages are a must and the book does a great job in showing them in action.The reason I suffixed the review with 'if you know a little R' is that data cleansing requires one to be fairly comfortable with somewhat arcane R syntax. If you don't know any R at all, it would be helpful to get a more gentle introduction - such asR Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks)- before you tackle this book.In summary, this is an excellent 2nd book on R to have as you try to deploy machine learning in real life.BTW, if you are looking for 3rd R book, my vote isData Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies (Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series)",
