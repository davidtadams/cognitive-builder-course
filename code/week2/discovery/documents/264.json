  "reviewText": "At first I was afraid this books would be too watered down compared to The Elements of Statistical Learning (which I also have on my shelf), and I suppose it is a bit if your interest is in learning how to derive the equations for various statistical methods. But what makes this book great is the introduction to R in the form of \"Labs\" where they walk you through statistical analyses of data sets (available for download from the authors' website for the book).  If you want a book that will give you a good foundation in the \"why\" behind the methods as well as the \"how\" of applying the methods to real data, this is it.  Though I recommend downloading (for free from the authors' website) a copy of The Elements of Statistical Learning to round out your theoretical knowledge.",
