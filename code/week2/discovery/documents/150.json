  "reviewText": "I rate this book 5* because it fully accomplishes its stated objective: to introduce business people and undergrad students to data mining using RapidMiner.It guides the user using simple 'real-life' examples which demonstrate a number of data mining techniques in a very simple way. No significant prior knowledge is assumed, except for being able to use spreadsheets and I suppose having some very basic statistical knowledge.I already had some experience with RapidMiner and know my way around databases and data manipulation. The book was still useful but I read across it fairly quickly. I would have preferred to see more info on the statistical algorithms explained in the book as well as some other more 'advanced' techniques such as SVMs. But I guess this was not the purpose of the book.If you want more details on the actual statistics behind the techniques then I would recommend Vercellis - Business Intelligence, Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making.",
