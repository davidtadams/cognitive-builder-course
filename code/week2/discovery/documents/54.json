  "reviewText": "If you are looking for a simple how-to book that gives you a lot of sample source code, this is not for you.  If you want to learn the concepts and theoretical underpinnings of various algorithms and techniques, this is a great place to start.  The authors clearly stress the concepts of data mining that can be applied to a variety of specific applications.  This is a must have volume for anyone wanting to truly understand the theories and concepts behind the various approaches to data mining and the tradeoffs involved with each approach.  Those with a background in artificial intelligence will have an easier time getting through this material but such a background is not necessary to gain a solid foundation in the topics.  It is well written and organized for self-study.  But it may be a little intimidating for some beginners.",
