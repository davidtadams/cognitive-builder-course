  "reviewText": "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques book is detailed, well-organized with good introduction. Every chapter has sub-headings and it is in a nice order explained with figures. There is introduction in the beginning of the chapter but it would be sufficient if you already read a data mining book. If you want to read more introduction it is better to go through few more books. There are small examples and exercises throughout the book. There is exclusively a chapter dedicated for outlier detection. This is better than few other data mining books that I had referred for the reason it covers a wide range of topics. There is detailed introduction about each chapter of the book. The contents of this book is available in pdf format and also there are slide presentations for each chapter. It is definitely worth reading this book.",
