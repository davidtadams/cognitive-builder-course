  "reviewText": "I've had (the first edition of) this book for a while now, and when I first read it some years ago, I thought that it was very comprehensive but written in a mind-numbing dry style. Fast forward a few years, during which I have (a) used some Machine Learning toolkits (including Weka) to solve real problems and (b) attended the Weka MOOC and re-read this book as part of the suggested readings in the class, and now I suddenly find it full of interesting insights and advice that I missed earlier.I think this book would be most useful for an intermediate level data mining professional who uses or adapts existing algorithms to solve problems (as opposed to someone in academia who builds completely new algorithms), but who needs to know the functionality and rationale behind each of the algorithms to effectively use them. This extends to not only the main algorithms for classification, clustering, association rule mining, etc, but also to algorithms for feature selection, preprocessing, etc. The book really comes into its own if you are also using the Weka toolkit - since the book is based on Weka, you can try things out for yourself to visually understand the concepts presented in the book. Weka has a very comprehensive coverage for various algorithms, provides a GUI and a CLI, can be called directly from the command line via java, can be embedded within your Java (or other JVM based language) program, and can also handle big data using its streaming algorithms, so its a good toolkit to learn and use. At the same time, the book has a solid focus on core Machine Learning concepts as well, so the knowledge you gain using Weka and this book is transferrable to other toolkits in the future.",
