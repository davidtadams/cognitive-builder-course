  "reviewText": "These guys have made a great contribution to the statistical literature.  It is a broad book that entends to summarize the latest methods available for data analysis.  The authors succeed in giving a statistical context with which to compare and contrast many statistical methods.  Some of the statistical methods discussed were developed in the past 5-15 years (SVM, boosting, LASSO, etc...) and haven't yet been put into a broader context.  While this book is not comprehensive in its treatment, it is the  best single book on data analysis available.",
