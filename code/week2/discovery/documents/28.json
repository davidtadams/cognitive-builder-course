  "reviewText": "I bought this book in the hopes that it would help me better explore the data from the Netflix Prize contest, which it did. I had been reading numerous Wikipedia articles, scientific papers, etc. on line and felt it would be useful to have a more general tome on the subject. This book covers many of the common, overarching themes i.e. clustering, neural networks, linear regression, etc. to varing degree. I only wish the examples involved slightly more complex data sets and more pseudo code was provided. I suppose since the book is very closely tied to WEKA, one could always dig through the source code of that application; but I feel that the authors could have provided a bit more of the strictly algorithm relevant code in the book.",
