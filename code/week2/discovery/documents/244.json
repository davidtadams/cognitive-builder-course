  "reviewText": "This is an excellent introduction to Data Science for the person who wants to gain a good understanding of the subject and what it can do for business. The authors&#8217; language is straightforward and they have attempted to simplify statistical nomenclature to avoid losing their less statistically qualified readers.Provost and Fawcett have put together a very accessible guide that explains what Data Science is and what it is not. Their work is realistic and practical. The book presents the theory behind the subject and includes practical applications that enhance the reader&#8217;s understanding. Provost and Fawcett are excellent at swiping away myths on the subject, myths that some commercial promoters of the subject may like to maintain.  The power of Data Science is amazing enough without reliance on myth.  The authors clearly state that Data Science is not the panacea for all ills, and that it cannot succeed without the understanding of people.Not only does this book deal with the theoretical and technical concepts of the subject, but it discusses how the discipline can work within an organisation and with such issues as data privacy.It is seldom one finds a book that is so clear and comprehensive.",
