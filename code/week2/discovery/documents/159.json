  "reviewText": "It used to be that only government agencies and corporate behemoths could maintain huge data warehouses. Now, that information is only a Web trip to Google away. With the combined power of Internet tools and cheap hard drives, search engines and archival databases can enable almost anyone to find information about almost anyone else.Today's challenge, however, is not finding or storing the data, but rather making sense of it. That's where Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection comes in. It shows how myriad distributed data streams can be harnessed to fight crime.Through easy-to-read prose, the reader learns how to use both public and private databases and networks to find threats and minimize risks. Besides explaining how data mining is done, the book introduces the reader to such techniques as intelligent agents (software that performs user-delegated tasks autonomously), link analysis (a process involving the mapping of the associations between suspects and locations), and text mining (a process used to identify a document's content based on linguistic analysis) and how they can aid law enforcement.For example, law enforcement in the United Kingdom use text mining to \"institutionalize the knowledge of criminal perpetrators and organized gangs and groups,\" author Jes&uacute;s Mena writes. Case studies buttress these points.This work is one of the first books to show security professionals the power of data mining as an investigative tool. As such, it is itself a powerful tool for the industry.",
