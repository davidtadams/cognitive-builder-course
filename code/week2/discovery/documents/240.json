I would argue about lending sole emphasis to the term &#34;data science&#34; since there is much about its application that might be accurately said to be art (this is just a personal thought, and doesn't detract from my appreciate of the book). I very highly recommend this source book even to those with fairly advanced skill sets in the application of data mining and related data activities.",
