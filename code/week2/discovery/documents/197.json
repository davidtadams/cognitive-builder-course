  "reviewText": "This book is a superb introduction to machine learning. It is ideally suited for under-graduates, but anyone will find it immensely useful to get their feet wet with machine learning!The author has excellent style of communication and his examples are simple and clear. The Math is explained in painstaking detail (even matrix multiplication). Advanced readers can easily skip these explanations, but novices will find them really useful.Added to that, the author has taken the extra effort to code up everything in python and has provided the code to play around with! (This book could also be a fun introduction to python, which is a lovely language to learn.) Many times you read some algorithm and try to implement the pseudo-code, only to find that it takes hours for you to make it work. Something as simple as linear regression could turn out to be a pain, if you have incorrect step sizes! Many books simply say \"use a small value\" for the step size, and you are wondering whether 2 is small or 0.001 is small! But this book goes one step further, and says, what value of step size to use for the example, so you first get something to work before you experiment with it.If you are teaching an under-grad CS course/introductory CS grad course on machine learning, then this is the book you need to use. Your students will love you :-).",
