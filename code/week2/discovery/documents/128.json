  "reviewText": "Anyone working in data mining and predictive analytics or in applied statistics in other areas should have this on their shelf.  It is well written and very comprehensive.  Not light reading but not a pure math stat book either.  It helped bring me up to date on many of the recent developments in machine learning and applied statistics.  An excellent reference.",
