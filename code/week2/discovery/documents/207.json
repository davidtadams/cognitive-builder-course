  "reviewText": "If you are on a journey to become a data scientist, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book.Since R is an open source language with a strong community, there is no dearth of information and tutorials which will help the beginner quickly get up to speed (I highly recommend 'R Cookbook' by Paul Teetor).What was lacking, in my opinion, was a book targeted at practitioners. A book which you can pick up and start using R in your work. A book which will compress the learning curve and equip you for real world mastery - to the point where, perhaps, you might head straight to Kaggle.com and take part in data mining competitions.The book by Luis Torgo admirably fills this gap. In the context of the case studies, the author painstakingly describes the challenges one would face in real life - such as - how to go about cleaning and munging the data, how to visualize and summarize the data, how to come up with plausible hypothesis and test them. Since data mining is as much art as science, this kind of approach where you see an expert in action and see how they go about making design choices is highly educational.Along the tour, you also learn about several popular add-on libraries such as xts, rocr and hmisc.Once again, an excellent how-to book and highly recommended as your 2nd R book.Ravi Aranke (longtaildata.com)",
