  "reviewText": "Most books on Data Science, Machine Learning and \"Big Data\" either oversimplify the underlying science and mathematical principles or are too deep to be understood by non-mathematical business professionals and those who seek to use these increasingly important decision making tools.  This primer for business professionals and others who wish to apply Data Science to practical decision making precisely hits the ideal middle ground explaining how these tools can be used in practical heuristic decision making; it presents the minimally required mathematical principles in the simplest possible form without being overly simplistic and obscuring the working principles.  It employs clear graphics and a simplified mathematical presentation of necessary formulas to the best effect in illustrating the tools of decision making.  It was written as a collaboration between a data scientist who teaches MBA's and business professionals, and a PhD researcher in Machine Learning who has applied these techniques in leading technology firms.In my opinion it is the best book on Data Science and Big Data for a professional understanding by business analysts and managers who must apply these techniques in the practical world.  One intention omission that is best filled by another handbook is on the data processing tools that are applied inexploiting these well explained principles: NoSql Databases, Hadoop, Scripting Languages such as Python, and Statistical Shells such as Weka, Orange, R and Matlab.--Ira Laefsky MS Engineering, MBA Information Technology Consultant and Physiological Computing Researcherformerly on the Senior Consulting Staff of Arthur D.
