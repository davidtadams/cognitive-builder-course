  "reviewText": "When I happen to read books like that I wonder whether my time has gone (er... from a cultural point of view, of course). You can find references to interesting subjects in the publication, but just references, and they are shown in a so elementary way that it makes the book suitable for absolute beginners, in data mining, data analysis, and computer science (i.e. first-job employees or financial executives). Walking along the sharp boundary between generality and triviality, the leading way slips many times down the latter side. A book of almost five hundred pages could have afforded to examine more deeply the relating subjects, avoiding repetitions (and sometimes to cut and paste) and the inflated style typical of slide shows. In my experience, this text is close to a lost opportunity, because the good general structure (a path from CRM basics to the most known tools), which I appreciated, has not been supported by a sufficient strength of linked subjects, leaving the book as similar as the skeleton structure of a not completed building. The book could be worth reading, but a reader facing five hundred pages would deserve more.",
