  "reviewText": "I just finished this excellent book on machine learning that I would recommend to anyone interested in this relevant subject.It is not a research oriented material, but it envisioned as a manual for someone interested in applying the techniques.It is written as a set of easy to follow tutorials on all major subjects in machine learning: k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, nave Bayes,logistic regression, support vector machines, classification with the AdaBoost meta-algorithm, FP-trees.Book also has an excellent appendinx on related math (linear algebra, probability) and Hadoop/Map Reduce.Each tutoral starts with very accessible approach to theory of the method,good examples and simple and small examples written in Python that slowly get more complex towards the end of the chapter.I have ran this book by couple of my colleagues who are authorities in machine learning,and they found it valuable as a starting point for learning practical machine learning.Few caveats:Although the book does not officially require significant background in the math,I think that knowing linear algebra and probability more than helps.Book is, to my greatest joy, Python oriented. What some might miss, however,is exposure to the same material throguh well known Java frameworks.",
