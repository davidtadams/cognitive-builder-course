  "reviewText": "Some of the other reviewers seem to be unclear on the concept of &#34;introduction&#34;, demanding rigor and depth - and, unfortunately, not suggesting any alternatives. If you want deep understanding of the algorithms, you will need to start with a proper textbook, like &#34;Pattern matching&#34; by Bishop, or &#34;Elements of statistical learning&#34; by Hastie and Tibshirani. If you want a more accessible, high-level presentation with examples that can be reproduced, in R, you want to get &#34;Introduction to statistical learning&#34;  by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. If you want a *really* accessible introduction to the techniques - again, with examples that you can try and build on - well, &#34;Machine learning with R&#34; just might be the best choice today. (On R side; if you have invested in Python,  Peter Harrington's &#34;Machine learning in action&#34; and books by Wes McKinney are a good bet). OK, this is not an outstanding book, it is under-edited and plain-looking - unfortunately, Packt follow the no-frills approach of O'Reilly - but it is friendly, reasonably well written, and offers a good deal of content. (Extra brownie points for Chapter 11). Let me put it this way: you want to read &#34;Introduction to statistical learning&#34;, but &#34;Machine learning with R&#34; is a good warm-up.",
