  "reviewText": "I grabbed this book because I am in epidemiology and biostatistics, and am always looking for ways to apply what's been learned in other fields to how we work with data here. There's a lot of amazing advances in data mining and in machine learning especially, so this looked like an interesting book.And truthfully, I did find about 10-15% of this book incredibly useful and interesting, and I'll be keeping it on my bookshelf for that alone.  But large chunks of the book were focused solely on using Weka (which we don't use here) or in describing data modeling techniques (which I was already well versed in).The parts of this book that I did find useful were those that focused on how to take those data modeling techniques and actually use them in a machine learning context. The way the book is set up makes it hard to just swoop through and pick those parts out, though -- which meant that I spent more time than I'd like weeding through the information I already knew to find the new and useful bits. That said, I'm not really the target audience for this book, which means that I keep coming back to it hoping that it will be something it isn't meant to be. And for what it is, I think it does a good job, although I think the utility would have been broadened somewhat if it wasn't so very focused on Weka users.",
