  "reviewText": "This book is a great introduction to the field of Data Mining.  I read it cover to cover, and found it hard to put down.  The Weka platform is easy to use and well explained in this book.  I have since journeyed into other Data Mining and Machine Learning tools, but I fall back on this book for reference.  Every data scientist should have this book on their shelf.",
