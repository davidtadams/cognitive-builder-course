  "reviewText": "I really enjoyed this little book. It was well-written (though the appendix of the current edition could use some light editing) and it presented the concepts in an easy to digest manner. The examples and wording of the explanations were excellent for a primer, and on a level that you rarely encounter. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a quick way to get their feet wet, as it will introduce you in a pleasant and effective way to the material. It was a very quick read that I think anyone would find accessible. I also found their website to be surprisingly informative and interesting, and I learned some new things that aided my comprehension of certain topics.It is highly unusual to find technical topics presented in such a well-designed way, so this was a refreshing surprise. I wish other writers and publishers would pay attention! I will most likely purchase any new titles they produce in the future.",
