  "reviewText": "I am new to Machine Learning and I found the book a very good hands-on introduction on the subject. The author takes 8 of the Top 10 algorithms in Machine Learning (based on a 2007 survey paper) and implements them in Python. Other reviewers have pointed out that the theoretical explanations and code quality were somewhat lacking, and thats true. However, even though Python is an extremely readable language, machine learning algorithms are (generally) hard, and I found that it helped to understand them better if I typed them out myself, copying/copy-pasting and restructuring the code as I went, and experimenting with the contents of the intermediate data structures in the REPL. Also, once you have a general idea of how it works, it becomes easier to parse the math in the paper on which the algorithm is based.I still don't completely understand all the implementations, but the book did give me some intuition about how to choose the right algorithm for a given problem. I believe that is also important since ML practitioners often use third party algorithms rather than code everything up from scratch. Of course, for the times you do need to code it up from scratch, you can get some valuable insights about machine learning algorithm design from the style adopted in the book - start small, visualize in 2D/3D for insights, then generalize to higher dimensions. The examples cover a wide range, from dating sites to semiconductor plants, so you get a feel for all the different places these algorithms can be applied.In short, if you want to \"Just do ML\", ie, quickly get started and pick up anything else you need along the way, then this book may be for you.",
