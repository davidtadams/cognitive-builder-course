  "reviewText": "As I consider myself a hacker rather than a coder I was delighted to find a title aimed for directly at me as \"for Hackers\". The topic of machine learning is both generally hot and personally interesting to me as I try to mangle recommendation approaches in the music domain and just finished with all worthwhile heuristics-based methods. I thought that this book could provide me with a good entry and could be a newer, more up-to-date approach than the classic Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran. Nonetheless I was a bit surprised to realize that the hackers' language should be R instead of Python - so this meant that the book would also serve me as an intro to R. As learning R is also on my long to-do list, I was hoping that I could kill two birds with one stone.The book has a solid structure, the first quarter is covering basic statistics showcasing the capabilities of R. Typical starter exercises of ML are well versed: Bayesian spam filtering, weighting schemes for ranking, regression, overfitting and optimization is explained and demonstrated with a down-to-earth and hands-on approach. The authors also touch some of the more complex topics: principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm are introduced with real world data. I was really delighted to see a longer chapter dedicated to social graph analysis and I totally give kudos for the inclusion of Gephi, the powerful open source graph visualization and manipulation software that I also enjoy using more and more.The authors come from a social science background and although this book seems to be avoiding 'programming' or providing code that could be incorporated in a runtime environment, I believe the goal they set, to provide machine learning tools for tinkering, has been reached with great success. It's short, concise and not scary at all.",
