  "reviewText": "This is a great book. I liked the way authors highlight syntax for models and discuss strengths and weeknesses. It has a nice balance of theory and hands-on training. However, I would need to use a R book, such as R in action, in conjunction with it.I have looked at many books on the topic. I will put my review for all of these. Perhaps this can save you some time.1) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470650931 : Good theoretical book, but badly written and does not have any hands on exercise.2) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466503963 : This is another great book. Good balance of theory and hands-on exercise. This is an excellent book to start learning data mining and R. However, this book relies on a GUI RCommander. It does a good job and one can do a lot with it but it has its limitations. However, I will still use this book.3) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439810184 : This is an advanced book and heavily entrinched in cases. This makes it difficult to replicate things unless your work is directly related to one of the case studies covered.4) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0133412938 : Good examples, but does not explain much about the interpretation. This leaves one wondering what is the purpose of certain graph, what are the axis and how to interpret it. if appropriate explanation is added, this would be an excellent book.5) http://www.amazon.com/dp/111844714X : This book is very expensive and almost totally devoid of any theory or discussion. I would not use it.6) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1441998896: This is a decent book. It relies on another GUI, Rattle. It is a strong contender to the book 2 in this list.",
