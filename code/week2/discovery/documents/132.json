  "reviewText": "Having to go thru some of the data mining such as CART, I find the book rather wordy.  Sometimes, it takes a couple of readings to understand, too many termiologies.  I think a lot of stuff might be better illustrated with mathematical formulae rather than words or both.  For e.g., I was trying to understand what is surrogate variable, getting a big picture from the English is okay, but to actually compute it, I find information not as clear.  This book is written in a way ... seem to be theoretical, and yet not rigorous enough.A lot of examples, but I do hope it's not so long-winded in description.",
