  "reviewText": "I used this book for my stats course at Stanford. While I do enjoy reading parts of the book, I have to say that I am rather dissappointed with the presentation in the book.1. This book assumes that you already have some background and quite a bit of familiarity with the subject2. While it contains many topics, most materials are only \"presented\" rather than \"clearly explained\". And so, while it may be good as a reference book, at least for me, this definitely shouldn't be your main resource when first studying the subject.3. Definitely the authors are expert on the field and I just hope they would come up with a much better revision of the book4. One nice feature of the book ... it contains pretty picture! Unfortunately, just like the old saying, \"a picture contains a thousand words\". Thats exactly what happens here. Some of the pictures are hard to understand.It may or may not be fair to give this book 1 star (I might update my rating in the future). But the simple truth is that I am not impressed when I first read the book. It surely falls below my expectation from such a highly acclaimed book.",
