  "reviewText": "This is a very good book for somebody who does not want to delve into the mathematics behind the algorithms. The book is concise and accessible. I found it very useful and practical especially to get a quick introduction or gist of a particular technique for interview purposes. It has R examples for almost everything discussed in the book. I am taking off one star as this book does not cover naive Bayes which is a very useful and popular algorithm. I am not sure why the authors left out such a popular and basic algorithm. Overall it's a great book.",
