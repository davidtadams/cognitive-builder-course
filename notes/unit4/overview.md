### Unit 4 overview

Goals
* Function of visual recognition
* machine learning & supervised learning
* implement this in python

This Unit will teach you how to train your first machine learning algorithm. We will use a component called Visual Recognition that can learn to detect objects or classes of content in an image. This is a supervised learning algorithm that needs to be trained on labelled images. The following lessons will guide you through the training process.

Lessons in this Unit
* create an instance of Visual Recognition and setup your credentials in Python,
* use the default prediction in Visual Recognition to detect content in your own images,
* train your custom classifier to learn to detect your own concepts,
* manage your custom classifiers in Watson Developer Cloud,
* evaluate the performance of a custom classifier using a simple accuracy metric.
