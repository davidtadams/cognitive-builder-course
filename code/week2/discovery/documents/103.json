  "reviewText": "As databases keep growing unabatedly, so too has the need for smart data mining. For a competitive edge in business, it helps to be able to analyse your data in unique ways. This text gives you a thorough education in state of the art data mining. Appropriate for both a student and a professional in the field.The extensive problem sets are well suited for the student. These often expand on concepts in the narrative, and are worth tackling.The central theme in the book is how to classify data, or find associations or clusters within it.Cluster analysis gets two chapters that are superbly done. These summarise decades of research into methods of grouping data into clusters. Usually hard to do, because an element of subjectivity can creep into the results. If your data is scattered in some n-dimensional space, then clusters might exist. But how to find them? The chapters show that the number of clusters and the constituents of these can depend on which method you adopt, and various initial conditions, like [essentially] seed values for clusters, if you choose a prototype cluster method like K-means.The descriptions of the cluster algorithms are succinct. Why is this useful? Because it helps you easily understand the operations of the algorithms, without drowning you in low level detail. Plus, by presenting a meta-level comparison between the algorithms, you can develop insight into rolling your own methods, specific to your data.Part of my research involves finding new ways to make clusters, and the text was very useful in explaining the existing ideas.",
