  "reviewText": "This text designed for quantitatively-oriented MBA students is a good second tutorial in R for just about anyone.  It gets to the use of R as a data mining tool for large data sets (something that is often neglected in basic tutorials). Its orientation is toward basic data mining and machine learning techniques.  Enough verbal explanation of each of the techniques is given so that less mathematical students can see the usefulness of each of these methods, and the illustrations are of high enough quality for an expensive textbook.",
