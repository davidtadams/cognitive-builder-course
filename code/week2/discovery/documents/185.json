  "reviewText": "This is meant to be a practical book. The author's &#34;objective is to provide a thorough discussion of the most useful data-mining tools that goes beyond the typical 'black box' description, and to show why these tools work&#34;. I think the result of reading and doing the exercises in this book is:1. I will have acquired some familiarity with regression techniques and a few of the problems they can help with2. I will have performed the regression techniques in ROver half the text focuses on various kinds of regression. Then there is a little bit on classification, decision trees, clustering, principal components analysis.However, I also think:1. The math is so fast --- mostly one definition after another --- that its inclusion is superfluous. If you know what the equations are, there is no need to see them here. If you don't, this presentation isn't a good way to learn them. These sections often say to check out the author's 2006 text &#34;Introduction to Regression Modeling&#34; for more details.2. The mentions of alternate software (Minitab, SAS, SPSS) are useless throwaways and should either be removed or expanded. Who cares if I have two brands of calculators that give me the same answer for 3 + 4? Likewise, there is no need to say that R gives the same answer as Minitab in a single example (pp. 88-92) or that some feature exists in SAS and SPSS (CHAID, p. 186).3. The exercises are extremely important for practicing.4. Examples sometimes have long program output. In my experience, it takes some practice to read the program output and understand what each number means, and this discussion is not really done in the text.From a statistics perspective, I would instead recommend Tibshirani, Hastie, Friedman: &#34;Elements of Statistical Learning&#34;. For machine learning techniques, Segaran: &#34;Programming Collective Intelligence&#34;.",
