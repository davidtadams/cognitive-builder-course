  "reviewText": "This is the only book I have read about Genetic algorithms, but it seems that it covers the field pretty well.In the preface it says that it is aimed a beginning graduate students, and since I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science and I just wanted to read it for fun I thought it would be for me. But I found that it uses way to many words to explain very basic things (e.g. almost a page to explain binary numbers) while many of the difficult equations just was presented without proper proof. So the book could have better if it had been cut down to a third and then supplemented with the proper proofs. So if you are a Computer Science graduate I cannot recommend this book. Given the fine books that Addison-Wesley usually publish I was quite disappointed with this one.But if you are a student in other fields and just want an \"intuitive\" impression of Genetic Algorithms without the mathematical rigor it is probably good.Chapter 1: An introduction to genetic algorithms with examples. This chapter is excellent.Chapter 2: The mathematical theory behind genetic algorithms. This is not done very well since many of the equations isn't proven or explained properly.Chapter 3: A Pascal program for the sample in chapter 1. This seems unneccesary since any proficient programmer easily could have implemented the program based on the information in chapter 1.Chapter 4: The history of genetic algorithms and a number of applications all taken from research. Both seem unneccesary.Chapter 5: An extension of the techniques presented in chapter 1. This is good.Chapter 6-7: Introduction to machine learning. Is ok.Chapter 8: A concluding chapter without any real new information.",
