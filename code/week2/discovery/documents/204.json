I'd say - pass on \"Data mining with R\", and go for \"Introduction to statistical learning\" by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani if you want a high-quality, accessible R-illustrated textbook, or for \"Machine learning with R\" by Brett Lantz if you are eager to jump into hacking, and value code over theory.",
