  "reviewText": "Python has an excellent ecosystem of libraries for Machine Learning. The libraries are all well-documented but sometimes it is hard to figure out how to solve a problem end-to-end using one or more of these libraries. This book attempts to fill that niche. It contains 12 chapters, each focusing on one or two ML problems, and shows how an expert ML practitioner would build and evaluate solutions for these problems. The main focus of the book is on the famous Scikits-Learn library, along with its dependencies Numpy and Scipy, but there is also coverage of gensim (for topic modeling), mahotas (for image processing), jug and starcluster (for distributed computing). The tone of the book is very practical and hands-on, in the rare cases where theory is explained, it is done without math. At the same time, the book is much more than just an introduction to Python ML libraries - you will come away learning \"insider secrets\" that you can do to improve your solution and which are already available as API calls within one of these libraries.The authors say that this book was written to their younger selves - in my opinion a very accurate representation of the target audience. I believe the people who would benefit most from the book are those who are programming using the Python/sklearn ecosystem already at competitions or at work but who are still not at the top of their game. This book can help you get (at least part of the way) there.",
