  "reviewText": "There are two or three things that I really like about this book.First, so many books of this type seem to leave off the first 20 or so pages that should tell you what it is that they are trying to do. Instead of assuming that you know what Machine Learning is all about, this book has an initial chapter that explains in simple terms what we are trying to do here.Second, instead us using some kind of psuedocode, the examples are written in a standard language, Python. Python is a free language in the open source community so students can get/use it without incurring the costs associated with some other languages. It is also intended to be very readable which makes the demonstration programs easier to understand. There is also a chapter on programming in Python.Machine learning usually is put into the computer science department in universities, and as a result is usually taught to computer science students. In fact, machine learning also requires more mathematical background and more engineering background than most computer science students have. The approach used in this book is to discuss algorithms used in machine learning, but to do so by stressing how and why they work.The author says that the book is suitable for undergraduate use. Yes, it is, but for the rather advanced undergraduate or even early graduate level student",
