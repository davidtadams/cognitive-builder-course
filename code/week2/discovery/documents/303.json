  "reviewText": "A problem with the other reviews is that they consider the book in isolation, as if no alternatives were available. \"Practical data science\" is not the only machine-learning-lite book on the market: Manning itself had published Harrington's Python-based \"Machine learning in action\", Packt offers \"Machine learning with R\" by Lantz, O'Reilly boasts \"Doing data science\" by Schutt and O'Neil, and, finally, Springer has \"Introduction to statistical learning\" by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. I have seen and reviewed all except Harrington's; for the purposes of this review, I'll ultra-briefly describe each contender (\"Machine learning with R\" - thin, average-quality, superficial, but effective at what it sets out to achieve; \"Doing data science\" - a mash-up of a textbook and a magazine article about kewl data scientists; below-average quality, but a lot of pop appeal; \"Introduction to statistical learning\" - high-quality, accessible and visually appealing textbook with R illustrations) and get to \"Practical data science\" - which, to me, comes across as a better-organized, earnest version of \"Doing data science\". The book's forte is its effort to go beyond a catalogue of R-illustrated machine-learning methods - and you have to have seen similar books to know how standard this repertoire is - and discuss practical skills useful to a budding \"data scientist\", from version control to presenting. I appreciate this effort, but feel that this content was not sufficiently substantial or polished to develop into a \"unique selling proposition\" of the kind that each of its competitors has - hence the title of my review.",
