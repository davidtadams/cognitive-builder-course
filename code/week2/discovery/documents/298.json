The examples in this book work really well and is well-explained.  Although I have never used Python before this, I feel that it is only a slight learning curve as it is always fun to learn a new language.  Most importantly, this is book is an excellent, quick deep-dive into machine learning.  Kudos to the author and publisher for making this book available to the public.",
