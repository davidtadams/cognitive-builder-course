  "reviewText": "The author want to write a practical, easy to understand book for ML subject. And I think this book accomplished this object pretty well. The book is concise and the top 10 most used ML algorithm is well explained without rigorous math. Moreover, to apply the theory to a practical problem, Python code example is well illustrated. Of course, the code has some flaw in itself, However, even I am a novice to Python, the algorithm and code is easy to understand. May be good for someone who want to learn ML in a practical manner. And if you know something about ML, this is a good complement with regard to a practical implementation of ML algorithm. However, this book in itself is not a good textbook to begin with. You better delve into several other good textbook and this is a good complement to it.Just a comment. I found out that the code error is illustrated in [...]. You don't worry about the code error!!!",
