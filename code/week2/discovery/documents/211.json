  "reviewText": "The book presents a very good introduction to the practice of data analysis, focusing on data mining techniques. The first part covers the essential steps in data analysis, including data loading, cleaning and preparation. Dividing your data in two different subsets for training and evaluation is an important aspect emphasized in this part. The second part takes a tour over popular data mining techniques such as clustering, association or SVM from a practical point of view. Finally, the last part describes model evaluation and deployment.The author has created an open source R library (Rattle) that offers a graphical interface to explore all methods and techniques described in the book. This is a invaluable asset to follow the examples and explanations in the book, specially for those readers that are not quite familiarized with R yet. In this regard, all low level commands can also be consulted in the log tab of the interface, allowing unexperienced readers to learn about R programming and the underlying libraries used throughout the process.In my opinion, the combination of a very readable book and the R graphical interface makes it quite an attractive option for introductory courses in data mining, or as a self-study reference to learn about the implementation of popular data mining techniques in R.",
