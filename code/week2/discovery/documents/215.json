  "reviewText": "... who found this book difficult to work through.I was really looking forward to working through this book as a way to get hands-on experience with some machine learning examples and learn R as well.  Unfortunately, I ran into issues that others mentioned regarding the heavy focus on data manipulation in R rather than machine learning.  I happened to buy an R book along with this one as part of a 2 for 1 promotion, and it was a good thing I did.  I'm now having to basically take a break from the MLFH book to read a few chapters of the R book so that I can follow along without having to break my concentration so much to figure out why my R code isn't working the way it's supposed to (Update: According to some of the other reviewers, the problem may be that the code in the book is simply buggy. Talk about a recipe for frustration!).  Also, since the companion code is stored on Github, which I had not used before, I wasted a lot of time learning Github, especially when it came time to update my versions of the code with the author's updated versions.  At the very least, the authors could have included a simple set of instructions on how to fork, pull, merge, etc. for this specific repository.Don't even get me started on the issues with Chapter 11.  In my eagerness, I skipped from Chapter 3 to Chapter 11 because I wanted to learn about working with social network data.  They might as well remove the chapter if they're not going to update it to reflect the changes (little warning boxes in the book are not sufficient).  I tried to plow through it even though I couldn't run all of the examples due to the changes in the Google and Twitter data services, but so far have given up.I really can't recommend this book at all.",
