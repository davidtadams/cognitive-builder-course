  "reviewText": "Fantastic book if you need to use WEKA; probably the best recommendation available.If, however, you're not going to be using WEKA then the book is still valuable, but I challenge the true 'practicality' of it. The content is thorough but perhaps more academically oriented than as industry focused as I would have liked. The author keeps it very accessible, particularly as far as mathematics and statistics go. While this might make the book a little more long winded - in my view it makes it a far easier to get into the groove and allows you to read it like a book.* Highly recommended for WEKA users* For others users I suggest you look through to see if it will really be helpful before plunking down the cash",
