  "reviewText": "What started out as an initiative by a few companies to make the Internet more social has resulted in many rich (and very large) repositories of human thought, which can now be mined for the insights it provides in the aggregate. This book shows you how to do so. It uses a case study format to describe how to download data off these repositories using the respective APIs, how to clean and analyze the data to find connections between entities using libraries such as NLTK, and build and navigate interest graphs implicitly created by these communities using libraries such as networkx. The cases use data from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and GitHub, as well as public datasets such as the Enron database.If you are looking for ideas about how you can use Social Network data in your domain of interest, as well as a cookbook that will take you there most of the way, then this book is for you (I fit that profile and I found the book really useful). The ebook version may be preferable because of its embedded hyperlinks out to reference pages on the Internet. The one thing I think would make the book even more effective and easier to read would be to present the code and results in IPython notebook format for the book, while still providing the full code on github.Disclaimer: I requested a copy of the book from the author to review it, and he very kindly made one available for me.",
