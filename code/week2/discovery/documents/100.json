  "reviewText": "I believe this book is a great reference for all data mining practitioners as well as for students of computer science and statistics. It covers both supervised and unsupervised methods. This is not the most updated book in the field but it is a great foundation for more studies and research.There is only one thing I didn't like about this book: the chapter about Neural Networks. I think it could be improved and there are other books such asInformation Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithmswhich describe this topic much better than in this book.There are available resources for instructor from Tan's web-site including some free chapters.[...]",
