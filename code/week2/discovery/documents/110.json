  "reviewText": "This book is quite good in the material it covers. However, other aspects, for example, decision trees, are only briefly covered. I think this is because this book provides a NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems conference) view of the world, where only certain aspects of the Machine Learning world are accepted.This book, together with Duda, Hart, and Stork's bookPattern Classification (2nd Edition)make an excellent pair.",
