  "reviewText": "This book was a great help at writing and programming for my thesis. It has a ton of information, and even I was able to understand and follow the math. The book has a great introduction chapter and then basically dives into 3 learning styles thereafter (Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, and Temporal Difference). After reading this book, I found it easier to read other papers (many of which are from the same authors).",
