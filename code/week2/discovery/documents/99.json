  "reviewText": "If you think you are interested in Data Mining this is a great place to start.  This book would work well for people interested in self study, or someone who is considering going to grad school to pursue a field utilizing data mining, or doing data mining research directly.The book covers the core data mining concepts, with clear examples on how the concepts could be applied to toy problems.  The book is light on math and heavy on application, which is great at maintaining interest.  This book is not commonly used as a course textbook at the grad level because of its shallow treatment of the underlying math.Sometimes you just want to know how, and worry about why later.Also, if you think data mining might be of use to your research or your professional work, this book provides a broad overview of topics.  If you are unfamiliar with data mining, and have just heard the term, running through the introductions of each chapter will quickly point you to techniques that will be most useful to you.",
