  "reviewText": "This book is quite good in explaining basics of pattern recognition and machine learning and enables the reader to relate the theory to diverse practical applications. The explanations are very simple. It is better to have thorough knowledge of random vectors and linear algebra to derive maximum benefit from this book. I would recommend this book to any one new to this field.",
