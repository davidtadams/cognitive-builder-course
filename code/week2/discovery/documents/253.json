  "reviewText": "In a fast paced world of Data Science,this book brings you up to speed  with essential tools that are required in mining the web. Halfway through the book, and I must say this is best technical textbook I have read for so far.(The first time all my codes ran without tweaking).Thanks to the ipython-notebook -virtual environment that accompanied the book.The author gives a somewhat thorough explanation of his codes. Every chapter in the book contains a lot of links to some important sites,so  you need to connect to the internet while reading the book.Late last year, I was watching a youtube video where Linkedin staffs were displaying  their clustered professional networks . I thought, \" these wise geeks , when I am going to cluster my own linkedin network like these guys? \" With this book, I did it in less than 15 mins.",
