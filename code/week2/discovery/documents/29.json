  "reviewText": "This book is very easy to read and understand. Unlike Hastie's Statistical Learning book, it is not geared towards those with an expert level knowledge of statistics, and instead takes time to explain functions and formulas for the person with a decent but not extrordinary understanding of statistical/math concepts. For example, their description of a Gaussian was the clearest I've seen. On the other hand, if you're math/statistics background is considerable, you may find this book somewhat simplistic or tedious.The book has a good coverage of techniques and algorithms, although I was somewhat disappointed that they do not mention Influence Diagrams, considering the amount of coverage of both decision trees and Bayesian techniques. Their discussion of Combining Multiple Models, however, is well done, and is not covered to this extent in most books I've seen. I also like how they broke out the discussion of input and output (knowledge representation) into their own chapters.Addendum 10/30: After reading a good hunk of this book I still agree with most of what I said earlier, but I do think the authors could have gone into graphical models a lot more. At the end of the discussion on Bayesian networks, Markov networks and other graphical models are mentioned very briefly and the author says they are very big in ML right now, but he doesn't say why they didn't describe them further. It might have something to do with the organization of the book. Graphical models almost need a chapter of their own but the book's chapters discuss all techniques in one chapter but with varying levels of detail.",
