  "reviewText": "The book machine learning by Mitchell provides a systematic overview of important concepts in the field. This is rather rare finding because most books present first of all algorithms but fall short communicating systematic insights that would help the reader to creatively develop methods by themselves.It is needless to say that any book with the title 'machine learning' is inherent incomplete due to the incompletenss of the field itself. For this reason this book is not state of the art of current algrithms. Instead, again, concepts are at the center of focus.Overall, well writen and a very good selection of examples and explanations. I recommend this to anyone for a general overview.",
