He makes a good case for using Excel as the teaching vehicle.  Certainly, there are more efficient tools to do tasks such as data cleansing and word counting, but his book is mostly about the concepts of data mining.  I plan on using this as a text to supplement an information systems course I teach.  Nice job!",
