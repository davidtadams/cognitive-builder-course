  "reviewText": "The content of the book seems pretty good.  I have only got up to about chapter four so far and it's easy to read and introduces material in a reasonably gentle manner.  The three stars are due to the fact that I am using the electronic version, on a kindle app on an Android tablet, and it has some issues.  It is mostly OK but suffers because quite a lot of the technical material is scanned rather than true font or vector which means that if you zoom in, the surrounding text gets bigger but the figures, formula and diagrams often don't.  This is particularly troublesome for mathematical formulas which are sometimes scanned at quiet low resolution and very difficult to decipher, not great when they are already quite complex to understand.It's usable though, much more convenient in electronic form and I've saved myself about $50 by renting the book on Amazon for four months compared to buying it at the Uni bookshop.",
