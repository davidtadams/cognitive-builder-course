  "reviewText": "A lot of books focus on data but don't walk you through the analysis. This book has great Excel and Open Office examples of each discipline. It is a great read and reference book for the data analyst.The last chapter was short and to the point and should not be missed. So much practical wisdom in such a few pages that will make you way smarter than the average bear.Funny and readable style too. Really a great book.",
