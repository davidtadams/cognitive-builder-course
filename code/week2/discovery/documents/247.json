  "reviewText": "I am reading a lot of  books about big data and this book is definitely must-read book. It is not about big data but it is about data and statistical approaches so that you can improve your vision and your strategy about data.  Especially they are giving good samples so it is very easy to get the idea. I like it...Additionally the book is focused on correlations not causality which is a very good approach for me.",
