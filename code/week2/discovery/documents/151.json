  "reviewText": "I rate this book at 5 stars because it is what it claims to be, namely, an introduction to data mining for people not familiar with the subject (i.e., \"the masses\").  It does this job well.  The book is practice oriented - you will not find a lot of theory.  It simply instructs the reader on how to use the RapidMiner data mining software to perform very simple data analyses.  (By the way RapidMiner is fabulous, and free, so try it out if you have not already!)  But be warned, if you have any experience at all with RapidMiner, then it will probably be too simplistic for you.  If you have any familiarity with data mining, it will probably be too simplistic for you.  It is VERY BASIC.  But, if that is what you are looking for, it does that job very well.",
