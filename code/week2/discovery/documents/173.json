  "reviewText": "Flach provides you with a very readable and concise book that covers several vast fields of computation. The subject is big data, to use a recent trendy label. He provides a clear narrative, where you can quickly understand the key underlying ideas. Amusingly, the first chapter has a long example about how to distinguish spam [unwanted bulk mail] from ham [regular mail]. A good pedagogic choice, for you learn about conditional probabilities and Bayes classification. It turns out that Bayesian approaches are common in the entire field of machine learning. So the first chapter correctly confronts this point and educates the reader.I would also point you to Figure 1.7. It is a qualitative 2 dimensional map of the models treated in the text. Models sharing characteristics are close together in the map. You get a top level qualitative appreciation of their properties. Useful when making decisions which to apply.The text also talks about a common problem when dealing with high dimensional data - the curse of dimensionality. As the number of dimensions increases, the data gets sparser. Ideally you want the data to be on a manifold - a surface of lower dimensionality unto which you can project the data prior to further analysis. Of course this just begs the question about how you can detect such a manifold. The book really doesn't say much further other than perhaps to look at a histogram of pairwise distances from a sampling.The section on support vector machines is especially nicely written. It cuts through a lot of jargon that exists in this topic. The geometric visualisation of what you are trying to find - a hyperplane that separates the data into 2 qualitatively different sections - is the main idea to keep in mind.",
