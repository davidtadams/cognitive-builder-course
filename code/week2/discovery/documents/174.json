  "reviewText": "This book is well organized and explains the backbones that comprises the machine learning technique. Firsthand it sees the ML in 30000 feet high and gradually lowers down to the specific point in which explains the technique in depth. If you are a professional or major in this field, reading this book will consolidate your knowledge. However, the explanation is not easy to understand and not for novice or non-professional. Highly recommended to those serious about machine learning.",
