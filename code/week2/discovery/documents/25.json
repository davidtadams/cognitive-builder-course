  "reviewText": "I have used this booh to help educated non-technical executives on the necessity and complexity of Data Mining and the relationship to the bottom line - profit.This book helps bridge the gap between the theory of Data Mining and the practical applications of Data Mining. It is helpful and recommended to people who have heard of Data Mining before and want to know more. This is not a book for those who are knowledgeable in Business Intelligence or Data Mining.This book does not talk about CRM applications. CRM applications are in a constant flux and material on them are better served by online publications.",
