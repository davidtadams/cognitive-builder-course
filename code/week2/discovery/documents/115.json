  "reviewText": "I was expecting that 700+ book will be scientific monograph. Disappointment: this is a textbook, American style textbook, with wide margins to make notes, color text, color frames, color pictures explaining what is linear regression, gaussian distribution and such.Just to be clear, as a textbook, this is very good text, and deserves 5 starts. But I am giving just one because of disappointment. Sending back to Amazon. This is not what I was looking for",
