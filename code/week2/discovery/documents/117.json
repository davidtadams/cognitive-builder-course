  "reviewText": "I am a PhD student in machine learning. Bishop is really gifted and he explains very well basic and advanced concepts of machine learning. I would say that this book is much more comprehensive than Hastie's Statistical learning bookThe Elements of Statistical Learning. Very good illustrations and very complete. I would definitely recommend it for those who want to learn statistical/machine learning on their own. The only thing that I don't like is that it often tries to present theories under a probabilistic framework. My personal opinion is that Probabilities is a nice way to present easy theories in a super complex way. I tend to think in a more linear algebra/optimization framework. After so many years in Academia probabilities still confuse me.  Hopefully the author doesn't use only the probabilistic framework, that is why I like it",
