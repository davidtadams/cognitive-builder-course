  "reviewText": "I liked this book!  Years ago when visible record computers were being introduced into companies I worked for Burroughs Machines selling and installing accounting, costing and other management systems.  Today we call it Business Intelligence.  So many of my customers improved their company's bottom line by being able to analyse which products were selling to which kind of customers, which customers bought Product A and so might buy Product B, etc. After I left the computer business I worked with many small businesses where the owner knew very little about data, never mind data analysis.  This quick-read book would have saved them (and me) a lot of time and effort. It's well written in every-day language. It has a little humor and a lot of good, hard, basic info in it - and you get an additional free report as a gift.  buy the book.",
