  "reviewText": "I am new to ML, and I found this book to be easy to read and easy to understand. So, from theoretical perspective it's probably a very good book. However, the code samples are just terrible. Obviously, the author is a scientist, and needs a competent developer that can help him with code samples. For some reason he feels the need to praise Python. As result, there is a code sample that says \"This code is a great place to demonstrate how easy it is to process text with Python\", but the example has at least three bugs in 15 lines of code - so the comment turns a compliment into embarrassment.Unfortunately, in many cases the author doesn't explain what he is trying to achieve with his code snippets. Once that is clear, there is usually a much simpler way to accomplish the same thing; with less numpy calls and more regular Python. I get an overall feeling that the book is for mathematicians and statisticians, who will look at code snippets as illustrations - and not for programmers. This feeling is reinforced by the fact that many code snippets in my electronic copy are *images* where nothing can cut and pasted; not to mention that 'el' and 'one', 'oh' and 'zero' look the same.Last, the book is published in 2012, but the author seems completely oblivious to the fact that there is Python 3 in the market.In summary, if this text was accompanied by competent code - it probably would be the best book on the subject",
