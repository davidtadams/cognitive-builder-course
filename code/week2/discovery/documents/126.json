  "reviewText": "I originally bought this book for coverage of some topics about which I know nothing. But having had it for just a week, I have been more impressed with what I have learned about stuff that I thought I knew. The material in Chapter 7 is one of several cases in point. The discussion of cross validation is great, and the way it is related to other aspects of the model selection problem is masterly. More generally, the book manages a nice balance between theory and application, and its scope is truly impressive. Thanks to authors and publisher.",
