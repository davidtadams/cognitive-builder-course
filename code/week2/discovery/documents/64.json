  "reviewText": "A text that makes it through a third edition means it is popular. This is intended for advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate level classes. Its structure is pure old-fashioned textbook. No bells, no whistles, no sidebars, no ornamentation. Necessary charts, illustrations and graphs are primitive.Fortunately, the two authors write in a reasonable clear way, pretty much free of academic phrasing.The goal is to teach the technology of turning masses of data into useful and usable information.The approach is very straight-forward and methodical. First, the authors explain what data mining is and move quickly into describing data, processing data, reducing data and, generally, organizing data for retrieval of information.There are exercises at the end of each chapter.The authors claim they wrote the book not only as a classroom text, but as \"an excellent handbook\" on the subject of data mining.It is that, but whether as a classroom student or on your own, you'd better have a reasonably solid understanding of statistics, match, C programming, database structure and more.In short, this is not an easy book for an easy subject.But it is a thorough, if very technical, introduction to data mining. Essentially only the serious need apply. Those who just need a general knowledge of data mining would best look elsewhere.Jerry",
