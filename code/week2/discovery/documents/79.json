  "reviewText": "According to my professor, it was one of the most accessible book for Machine Learning subject. I agree in the sense of the examples it contains. They are well explained and you can understand the general concept from them.However, this book is not so easy to read, especially if your maths are not up-to-date. The formulas are there if you want to code each concepts, but it is really hard to transpose them directly to code.This is the kind of book that goes well with a class or a resource person that can answer your questions.",
