  "reviewText": "As a previous reviewer has observed, this book addresses the \"data mining\" forms of machine learning, but ignores the agent form of machine learning (such as a robot that learns). The ideas in the former are relevant to the latter, of course; it just seems odd to have them ignored in a book called Machine Learning. Regardless...This is a well done book covering a wide range of topics and covering them well. I don't think one would want to use it (as the sole textbook) in a first class for machine learning because it lacks practical information and examples about how to get down to it. However, it would be good for a graduate-level course of people who already had some hands-on experience but could then benefit from stepping back a bit to understand the field. It would also be good for people who have some mathematical sophistication and work with machine learning researchers, and want to understand better what the field entails.I do like the discussions of things like data transformations and especially the discussion of how to conduct experiments. How to think about evaluating things carries through the book, but there is an explicit chapter on this at the end as well.Since I don't see the contents listed anywhere on Amazon, I'll list them here:1. The ingredients of machine learning2. Binary classification and related tasks3. Beyond binary classification4. Concept learning5. Tree models6. Rule models7. Linear models8. Distance-based models9. Probabilistic models10. Features11. Model ensembles12. Machine learning experimentsThis is a very good book, and I'm pleased to have it.",
