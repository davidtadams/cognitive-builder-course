  "reviewText": "This is extremely intuitive and general point of view on ML.good for quick reading and getting introduced to the topic.I'd recommend this to people starting ML.then move on to more mathematically rigorous and specific books such as\"Pattern Classification\"/ \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\" / Hastie's \"Element of Statistical Learning\"i never say this for a book. but it is too pricey for what it is offering.FYI i think they should increase the price of Chris Bishop's book.",
