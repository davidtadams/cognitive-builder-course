  "reviewText": "This was written to be a textbook from the start, complete with question-sets from at the end of every chapter. If you're a student you won't have any choice as to the book selection, however if you are looking at this more from a practical commercial standpoint you will have many choices and this may not be the best one. I think in many ways it tries to be very encyclopedic and covers a huge amount of background information that is probably perfunctory in industry. The book would be more useful as a desk reference with heavy editing, more real-life examples... perhaps along the lines of case studies that may fit outside of a curriculum based arc.Minuses:- Not very illustrative, when there are diagrams and visual examples they tend to be very bare bones- Some of the screen shots are absolutely terrible resolution (ex. page 602/603)",
