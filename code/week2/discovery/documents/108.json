  "reviewText": "Dr. Bishop is one of the brightest minds working in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning.  This book, appropriate for study at the advanced undergraduate level, discusses the major topics and techniques.There is a considerable amount of math required for understanding -- primarily matrix algebra.  There is no computer code, and there are no algorithms.  All of the analysis assumes stationary data.Recordings of several of Dr. Bishop's presentations are available on YouTube.  Watching them will help understanding of this book considerably.  Overall, it is an excellent book.",
