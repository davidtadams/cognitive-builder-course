## Lesson 1 - Typology of Intelligent Technologies

### Goals
1. recognize what is cognitive technology and what is not
2. relate intelligent functionalities to supervised or unsupervised learning strategies

Intelligent/Cognitive technologies:
* capacity to build and model a user, environment, any reality
* comes from integration of machine learning

Machine learning
* Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
* learning = modeling
* gives an algorithm to find out what would be the best model to model a problem or set

Supervised learning
* you provide all of the context needed to make decisions
* inputs (atributes, predictors) -> model -> output (response, target)
* take data and create a model on that data
* phases:
  1. training phase
  2. application phase
  3. evaluation phase

Unsupervised learning
* let exploration happen and make sense of environment
* starts from the data itself and tries to build a relationship or model from the data
* phases:
  * training phase -> builds model
  * evaluation phase -> occurs while using
  * sometimes there is an application phase
* most of the value comes from the model itself
