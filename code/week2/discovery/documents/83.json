  "reviewText": "If you want a very close look under the hood of Bayesian Networks, I can highly recommend Probabilistic Graphical Models.  It's extremely comprehensive (1,200+ pages), well structured and clearly written.  Theory, computation and application - including how to think about causation - are all covered in depth.  Not light reading and not suited for those with limited stats background, but all in all one of the best textbooks on analytics topics I've ever read.  Very impressive.",
