  "reviewText": "As a practicing statistician/data analyst, this is an area that I would like to know more about.  The book gives a high level business overview, though it was thin on details that would appeal to a practising &#34;data scientist&#34;.  That seems to be the current phrase for people that work in the intersection of statistical analysis, data processing, business intelligence and that sort of thing.Like much business writing, it seemed to me to be a combination of useful information, tub-thumping, cheer leading and buzzword scattering.  I went to an IBM conference on &#34;big data&#34; a few years ago, that left me with the same impression.  I suppose one can't expect much more than that from a fairly short book, or a one day conference. For example, you learn something about at thing called Hadoop, but not much about how it works in any technical sense.  That was my impression, anyway.So, in summary, the book is ok for an intro to the subject.  One senses that the area has potential benefits, but it's still hard to really pin it down.",
