  "reviewText": "Data Science for Business attempts to provide business professionals with what they need to know about data science.  The introduction says that one of the best uses based on feedback has been for professionals who aren't involved in data science to bone up enough to be able to assess and hire a data science professional.  That approach, providing a good level of information for someone who is not a data scientist but who has to work with them, gives a good feel for what this book is.The book is broken into chapters, each of which discusses some aspect of data science.  At the end of each chapter is a one page summary.  For a very quick overview of data science, it is possible to read through the 12 chapter summaries, and then read the last two chapters which bring together concepts from the book.  Then, the entire in depth chapter is there for reference, as you have to apply what you've read.  That's what I did anyway - read the chapter summaries and then went back and read portions of chapters.  I feel like this gave me a good overview of the topic, and then I have the in depth material available.  It's hard to know where else I would get both in an easy to navigate format.Overall, this is a good tool for you if you want to get an overview of data science but don't need to take a deep dive.  It discusses the principles and structural things in the field.  It does not discuss mathematical equations.  So, the book brings the field together and gives the big picture understanding.  Then, to actually do a project, you would take strategies, like the ones in this book, and go find specific equations and tools to implement those strategies.  This is a good approach to take to be able to see the forest and not just trees.",
