  "reviewText": "How often do the authors of the canonical text in a field recognize the need for a comprehensive introduction to the subject? Not often, I think, but here you have it. I just completed the Coursera Data Analysis course (also excellent) where I was encouraged to read and refer to the canonical text but  I simply was not prepared for it; I bought it but I could not make use of it.I have now plowed through every last chapter in this book, 10 chapters in all, doing the R Labs along the way and I feel fully prepared for the online course the authors are teaching at Stanford this January (2014) and also fully prepared to tackle The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, which is what I mean by the canonical text.This book is a gem and I highly recommend it.",
