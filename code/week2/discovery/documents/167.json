  "reviewText": "I dabble in the Machine Learning field.I have a very technical background but when it comes to Machine Learning, it is usually difficult for me to really understand the science at a deep level. This book changed that for me.  It introduces the concepts of ML and Data Mining in a wonderful way, which allows the reader to quickly pick up the deeper issues in the field.I highly recommend this book to anyone starting out in the field.",
