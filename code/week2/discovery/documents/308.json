  "reviewText": "Learned a lot from it. Methods that I previously searched for, hard, like PCA, MDS and so on, are now in one book. It generally explains the logic quite well. It also re-covers most of the topics in machine learning, lick ROC and feature selections. I consider it as my practical guide in all-day python programming.Good as it is, to be honest, this print contains lots of errors. It includes formatting errors, like the indents are not aligned, which are deadly in Python writing and reading. I also suspect that some graphs are erroneously labelled, For example, there are a series of graphs in Chapter 5 depicting the train errors and test errors, but the test errors are obviously and consistently lower than the train errors, which is practically not very likely. Plus the authors in-text description also contradicts the graphs (i. e. &#34;dashed lines are test errors&#34;, &#34;stay above 0.4&#34;).Some of topics are explained very well. I am very grateful that the authors dissected the PCA and LDA so well. Learned a lot there. But the book as a whole is not consistently so &#34;layman&#34; from the shallow then to the deep. It is a shame that some of topics are gone over too quickly. Especially the pattern recognitions and genre classification, both of which deserve much detailed explanation since they are not very &#34;bread-and-butter&#34; tasks that the majority of us face every day.",
