  "reviewText": "I really like Kurt Thearling's writing, in general--he has written some very clear and practical papers on data mining.  But I was badly disappointed by this book.  I should have guessed from the complex title that the book is merely an attempt to cash in on the current interest in &quot;customer relationship management&quot; or CRM.  In my opinion, CRM is not about data mining--see Dick Lee's book, The Customer Relationship Management Survival Guide, for a much more substantial treatment of CRM.  In trying to be a book about CRM, this volume also does a poor job explaining data mining techniques--I strongly recommend Linoff and Berry's second book, Mastering Data Mining, instead.  In short, I don't think that this is the book you want, no matter what you might be looking for.",
