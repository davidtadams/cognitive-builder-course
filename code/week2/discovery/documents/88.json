  "reviewText": "I agree with reviewer Frank \"Good introduction but not well structured, May 8, 2005\" the authors are over-anxious to establish the credentials of RL in older research traditions. Much of the talk about optimal control for instance is confusing because this is a vast field and its assumed you know it. I found myself looking up some of the technical terms from other fields. In the end learning about these concepts didnt help my understanding. This is a pity because the concepts behind RL are relatively simple/However in general I really enjoyed this book and this is the most accessible (while still being comprehensive) RL introduction out there.",
