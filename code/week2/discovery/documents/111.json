  "reviewText": "I like this book and refer to it quite a bit.  Pretty much all the background material one needs is in there.  However, the book is a bit advanced for an initial exposure to the material, and the perspective is very strongly Bayesian.  This means some some difficult concepts are introduced early on.  The presentation of the EM algorithm in general (and Gaussian mixture models in particular) is one of the best I've seen.",
