  "reviewText": "This hard cover handbook and text in Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques gives a wide and understandable overview of these methods. More than 80% of the text is readily understandable without recourse to advanced statistical and linear algebra methods, due to extensive verbal description of the nature of these algorithms and their applications, as well as illustrations and pseudocode algorithms.  Unlike the other excellent text in the Morgan Kaufman series by Witten, Frank and Hall there is no emphasis on a particular data mining package (I own both texts). Slightly more treatment is provided of two important modern Machine Learning Methods--Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.This is a modern and understandable treatment of the important topics of Data Mining and Machine Learning designed to be used as a classroom text.",
