  "reviewText": "Stephen has done a great job and making a complicated topic accessible. He has mastered the art of knowing when to provide extra treatment of the formulas in the book. The use of code alongside the concepts also helps clarify what is going on. Actually, the code alone is worth the price of the book. It really does make all the difference. I think anyone with some mathematical sophistication (a calculus course, linear algebra, and discrete math) will have no problem reading the book and working through the material. In other words, you don't need a PhD in math to learn from Stephen's great mastery of the topic.",
