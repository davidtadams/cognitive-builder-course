  "reviewText": "RapidMiner is an open-source, freely-available data mining software suite that uses a graphical-process-workflow approach similar to SAS Enterprise Miner or SPSS Modeler (formerly the Clementine product suite).  RapidMiner is very powerful with many built-in operators and it also contains an R-extension module so any R code or functions can be incorporated into its environment, giving it enormous flexibility.  And since it is a guided graphical user work environment, the learning curve for new users is much more friendly than that of a true text programming interface such as R itself.However, RapidMiner suffers from a general lack of awareness here in the USA and relatively scarce documentation for learning the program.  This book is definitely not a RapidMiner user manual, but it does provide a guided series of exercises to perform different types of data mining exercises in RapidMiner.  It would be very helpful for training new analysts on the basics in RapidMiner, and the fact that it provides actual datasets (downloaded from a companion website) so that the analyst can \"work along\" with the text is essential.  The book covers topics such as basic data preparation, clustering, discriminant analysis, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural nets, and text mining.  Overall, it would be a terrific guide if you were interested in learning how to use a free and open source tool for these types of advanced data analysis (far beyond what you can accomplish in Excel or Access alone).  If you haven't yet explored RapidMiner as an alternative to high-priced commercial analytical and statistical software, perhaps this book will provide the encouragement to do so.",
