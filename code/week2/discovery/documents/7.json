  "reviewText": "This book is a redaction of many different white papers on the topic of machine learning. The material is very credible and accepted in the field, with very little (if any) temporal information (short term at least). With that said, it is also very dry and academic, and requires a solid background in mathematics to understand. Even if you are in the field, you're likely to read certain pages several times to embrace a concept... but once you embrace it, you will have some of the best foundational knowledge there is on the subject. If you're in the machine-learning field, you'll benefit from revisiting some of these subject, and probably learn a new thing or two.",
