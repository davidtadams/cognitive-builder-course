  "reviewText": "I read this book about 7 years ago while in the PhD program at Stanford University. I consider this book not only the best Machine Learning book, but one of the best books in all of Computer Science. It covers every branch of ML I know of and it covers it really well. I found Mitchell's chapter on Neural Networks more insightful than an entire book on NN's that I read. I also found his chapter on Reinforcement Learning more useful and better explained than an entire book on Reinforcement Learning that I also read. The other chapters cover other ML topics at the same level of quality and rigor.The author did an amazing job in covering the breadth and depth of ML in less than 500 pages. I hope he will write a new edition to cover the advances that happened in the last decade.",
