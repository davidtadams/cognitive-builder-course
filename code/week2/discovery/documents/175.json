  "reviewText": "Pros:* R is a free software and even if a reader isn't familiar with it, they can type the examples and get the results. From my experience, hands on is helpful in learning and retaining concepts* Covers a pretty wide variety of R libraries: arules, car, class, cluster, ellipse, igraph, lars, lattice, leaps, locfit, MASS, mixOmics, mixtools, nutshell, ROCR (prediction, performance and plotting), startnet, textir, tree, VGAM. (check out the CRAN website for the full list of libraries available for R)* Chapters are well organized around topics* Graphics are nice and easy to understand* Topics are relatively easy to digestCons:* R code in the book should be better notated for R novices.* Requires some knowledge of statistics (but it's unlikely that a non-stats experienced person would be selecting this book for reading or reference)* Odd references thrown in regarding comparison to other statistical software.* Not for in-depth knowledge of each of the principle analyses, but more for generalists.If you're a super techy person who delves deeply into statistics, this is probably not theoretical enough for you. If you're an R or math dabbler (MBA or not), it's a good intro to many of the data mining analytical tools available in the current R libraries.",
