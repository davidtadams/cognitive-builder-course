  "reviewText": "This book assumes sufficient knowledge of data warehouse and CRM. This book deals purely with Data Mining - one of the branches of Business Intelligence.A very good book that includes chapters on business value and business case for an enterprise wide Data Mining solution. Certainly is helpful to me in my goals to pursue data mining solutions for clients.Good understanding of a &quot;profitable customer&quot; is a prerequisite for an enterprise wide data mining solution - which is emphasized in this book neatly.Can be used to educate marketing/sales/operations executives about data mining concepts and principles. Unless there's an executive buy-in, the concept will not sell in an organization. Business values and business case chapters will help one is selling this concept to higher-ups and help associates understand data mining in theory.My theory is that, data mining implementations would help organizations coming out of this economic mess, in reducing  marketing/sales/operating costs based on understanding the customer profitability and customer segmentation. Unless you spend on your customers, customer loyality is not assured. Why spend a lot on all customers when not all are created equal?This is the book that will justify such questions and pave the way for a profitable business.",
