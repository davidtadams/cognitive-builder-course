  "reviewText": "Used this for my DSC 340 class (Data Mining class).This book does a great job with overviews. By that, I mean it explains a general topic fairly well. However, when it comes down to &#34;how to&#34; steps, the book is of almost no help. If there are &#34;how-to&#34; guides, they are very poorly written and extremely hard to follow. For most topics, it simply compares and contrasts different how to methods without actually explaining how to do them.",
