  "reviewText": "I selected this book, hoping to understand the difference between Data Mining, which I wasn't familiar with yet, and the fields already known to me of Machine Learning and Statistics. This book provides very good overview of Data Mining techniques in general and it is also packed with lots of practical examples, giving good intuition on what actually Data Mining is and how it is related to Machine Learning and Statistics.",
