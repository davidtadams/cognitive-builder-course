  "reviewText": "This was a required book for my Data Mining & Business Intelligence class for the 2013 fall semester.  It's not exactly an exciting read, but there are some very useful descriptions of algorithms and techniques for data mining and data presentation.  I did lean on it heavily to get a lot of my semester homework completed (none of my homework was problems found in the book).All in all, it is a decent tome;  not stellar by a long shot, but I can see myself using it as a reference going forward.  If you are planning on being a data scientist or data miner, this is probably one of the few books you won't want to sell back.",
