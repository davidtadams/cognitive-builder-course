  "reviewText": "Data Mining and Business Analytics with R by Johannes Ledolter is a practical and useful introduction to the broad and increasingly important topic of data analytics using the powerful statistical software,R. After recently taking a rigorous MITx EdX data analytics course, I found this book of particular value. The use of the open source statistical software,R, provides a powerful platform for the analysis of large data sets and having book which can take a novice through the steps using many detailed examples is valuable. While the book goes through the R code used in some detail, it would probably be of more value to the reader if they had already been exposed to introductory R.The book contains 19 chapters and covers the essential areas for getting a user up to speed using R for data analytics. Examples of major topics include: Linear Regression (including multivariate analysis); Logistics Regression; Binary Classification; Classification using a Nearest Neighbor (k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm); Decision Trees; Clustering; and Text Analytics. The book includes a fair amount of the R code used in the examples and many different types of graphs which highlight some of the extensive graphing capabilities found in R. A website link is also provided, allowing the reader to download both the data and the associated R code to either go through the examples or reuse it for other data analytic projects.Overall, I recommend the book for those users who want to fine tune their data analytic capabilities using R.",
