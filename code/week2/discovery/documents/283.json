  "reviewText": "With all of the hoopla over Big Data, it is nice to see the author step back and cover the basics of Business Intelligence.  The book has a lot of stories that help explain the sometimes complex topic of BI and is even an easy fast read.  But, don't let that fool you, it still covers topics such as Outlier Detection, Pattern Recognition, ETL, and more...But, don't stop with just reading the book, there is also some great learning in the appendices.Overall, I enjoyed this fast read and I think it is a good foundational book on Business Intelligence.",
