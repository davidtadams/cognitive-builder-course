  "reviewText": "Bishop's book about machine learing and pattern recognition is well written and the figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative. Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in. In my opinion only the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. looks comparably well.The book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers and the coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth. This is not really a draw back because no book is able to do this anyway. The presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method.What is the problem: I do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples. That mean Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic. This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic to reduce the barrier of understanding by providing examples to visulalize the problem. The problem is, in my opinion, that this is not the case but the oposite. In think it is never wrong to provide examples and it is absolutely desirable but after the examples are given and one has an intuitive understanding of the problem one wants to see its formal solution because that's what machine learning is about, it is applied statistics. For this reason I give only 4 instead of 5 points (but not less because also all the other books about this topic fail in this respect).Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches.",
