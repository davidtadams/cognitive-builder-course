  "reviewText": "Very good book on probabilistic approach to machine learning. It goes from the elementary building blocks of probability distributions, up to the higher level frameworks of Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs. The best book I've read so far on Bayesian Networks in a continuous and hybrid space. It's quite heavy on math, especially linear algebra and matrix manipulations.",
